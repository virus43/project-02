# Instructions

**Basic**

* The object of the game is to become the wealthiest player through buying, renting, and selling of property. Each player begins the game with $1000. When one player runs out of money, the game ends, and the other player wins. High scores are awarded for particularly rich players who win the game upon bankruptcy of their opponent.

**Game Play**

* Each player clicks the die to roll for first turn. The player with the highest number goes first. Each player starts at the corner marked "GO."
* The first player rolls the die and his/her token moves the number of spaces indicated by the die.
* The tokens remain on the spaces occupied and proceed from that point on the player's next turn. Two or more tokens may rest on the same space at the same time. 
* Depending on the space your token reaches, you may be entitled to buy real estate, or be obliged to pay rent, draw a Chance card, or lose a turn according to the space.

**Property and Rent**

* Whenever you land on an unowned property, you may buy that property from the Bank at its printed price.
* If you decide to buy the property, the other player pays rent to you every time they land on that space, based on how much the land was worth when you bought it. Rent is one half of the original property price.
* You may choose not to buy a property if you think it is too expensive, leaving it open for the other play to buy it, should they land on that space during a subsequent turn.
* If you do not have enough money to cover the price of the property, you will not be able to buy it.

**Special Squares**

* GO - Each time a player's token lands on or passes over GO, the player collects $200.

* One Way Street - A player who lands on this space went the wrong way down a One Way Street, and subsequently must pay a fine.

* Fog - A player who lands on this space got lost in the fog, and subsequently loses a turn.

* Jail - A player who lands on this space got busted and is stuck in jail. The player must pay a fine to get out.

* Chance - A plater who lands on this space receives a card with a random consequence. The consequence can be positive or negative depending on the player's luck!
